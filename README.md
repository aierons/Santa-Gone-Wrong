# Santa Gone Wrong
Santa has lately been giving out terrible gifts to children. 
You refuse to continue in this disaster and thus must prevent him from ruining your childhood furthermore by stuffing the chimney or throwing his presents back at him and he’ll hopefully get the message. <br />

He won’t. <br />

The child has an infinite arsenal of bad gifts to throw at Santa. It’s the collection of gifts from Santa throughout the years. <br />
<br /> They’re all hammers. <br />
<br /> Santa will get knocked back when hit by the bad gifts though! <br />
Keep in mind that Santa might come to his senses and attempt to deliver the horrendous presents through the door. <br />

This is a local 1v1 competitive 2D platformer with hammer shooting and present retrieval.

This game was made with a trial version of GameMaker Studio 2 and thus has certain restriction, including but not limited to: 
number of objects, sprites, and inability to create an executable. 

To run this game, GameMaker Studio 2 would be required. Download the repository onto a local location and open the file with yyp file in GameMaker Studio 2. Press the run button and the game will begin. 

# Objective
There will be two players in this game, the child and Santa. The game has a timer of 90 seconds before a player is delcared as the winner.<br />
<br /> The child can pick up the scattered presents and stuff them into the chimney to block Santa's passage. If the child places 10 presents into the chimney before the timer ends, the child wins. In addition, if the child holds off Santa after the timer runs out, the child wins. <br />

Santa can remove presents from the chimney enter the house through the door. As long as Santa enters the house before the timer runs out, Santa will have won the battle. The child now has more hammers to add to the pile of ~~disappointing~~ Christmas gifts.
