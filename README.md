# Santa Gone Wrong
Santa has lately been giving out terrible gifts to children. 
You refuse to continue in this disaster and thus must prevent him from ruining your childhood furthermore by stuffing the chimney or throwing his presents back at him and he’ll hopefully get the message. <br />

He won’t. <br />

The child has an infinite arsenal of bad gifts to throw at Santa. It’s the collection of gifts from Santa throughout the years. <br />
They’re all hammers. <br />
Santa will get knocked back when hit by the bad gifts. 

This is a local 1v1 competitive 2D platformer with hammer shooting and present retrieval.

This game was made with a trial version of GameMaker Studio 2 and thus has certain restriction, including but not limited to: 
number of objects, sprites, and inability to create an executable. 

To run this game, download the repository onto a local location and GameMaker Studio 2 would be required as well for this progress.
